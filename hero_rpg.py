# Python Project, Text Based RPG Game 

# In is a RPG game, the hero fights goblins and zombies. The hero has the following options:
# 1. Fight a goblin or zombie. The fight encounters are random.
# 2. Run away from the fight which can randomly result in either escape or staying in the fight anyway. The hero may be hit while attempting to run.
# 3. The hero can also gain gold from downed creatures. I subbed gold for power because what's an rpg without gold?!
